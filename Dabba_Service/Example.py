//Create a python program that takes an array of user objects as a prop. Each user object will have properties like `id`, `name`, `city`, and other relevant information. The component should render a list of users grouped by cities. Display the city name as a heading, and under each city, list the names of the users belonging to that city. 

//For example, if the input List is: 

const users = [ { id: 1, name: "John Doe", city: "New York" }, { id: 2, name: "Jane Smith", city: "Los Angeles" }, { id: 3, name: "Bob Johnson", city: "New York" }, { id: 4, name: "Alice Brown", city: "Chicago" }]; 

print const user[city]
